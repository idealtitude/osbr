### Open Source Bible Reader

As the name of the app says it: osbr is an open source Bible reader...

Written in C++20 it's a simple console application to read the Bible (for the moment only in french) from text files located in a folder of the app.

I plane to put several different translations of the Bible that are Royalty-free. At the moment when I write this README file, the only translations a:

* Darby
* Segond
* Colombe

I'd like also to add the original hebrew and greek texts.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, I'll be more than happy! It's not particularly a difficult one, but for me who is a beginner in C++, it's challenging, even if it's just a console app.

I'll update this file, God willing, to add more infos about the project and the state of its development.

To use the program you'll need the folder containing the text files of the Bible, and put it at the root of the project. The [archive](https://stephane.life/projects/osbr/BibleDir.zip) of this folder is located on this page:

That's all for the moment...
